A) Selenium Coding with Java Streams:
1) Java Stream are introduced from version 8 which comes with many helper methods to write simplified
   and optimized code.

B) Java Streams, Lambda Expression for building Optimized Code:
1) What are Streams?

i) Stream API is new feature avilable from java 8
ii) By using stream, we can perform various aggregate operations on the data retured from collections classes
    by drastically reduce the complexity of code.

2) What is Lambda Expression?

i) Lambda expression introduce the new arrow opertor -> into java. It divides the lambda expression
   in two parts.
ii) The left side specifies the parameter required by the expression, which could also be empty if no
    parameter are required.
iii) The right side is the lambda body which specifies the actions of the lambda expression.

C) The working of stream can be explained in three stages:

i) Create a Stream
ii) Perform intermediate operation on the initial stream to transform it into another stream and so on
    further intermediate operations
iii) Perform terminal operation on the final stream to get the result.

An important characteristics of intermediate operation is laziness.
When executing this code snippet, nothing is printed to the console. That is because intermediate
operations will only be executed when a terminal operation is present.

Note: The aggregate operation that we perform on the collection, array or any other data source do not
      change the data of the source , they simply return a new stream
